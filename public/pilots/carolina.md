## Biography
Born deep within Union space, Lyra Vickers grew up dreaming of exploring the stars. The third daughter of a family of scholars in the Rocky Mountain Line, where the rest looked to the past, she looked towards Union's future in the vast unknowns. Lyra spent her university years pursuing such an interest, and joined a Far-Field Team straight out of college. Her first expedition gathered in Cradle before stepping off, allowing her a glimpse of humanity's origins before they headed towards humanity's future, closer to their shared past than any Vickers family member before her.

Lyra once had a dog named Carolina, and in college started calling herself Carolina to differentiate from her mother, Lyra Vickers, Sr. 

Carolina has enjoyed six expeditions. Every expedition was five subjective years in near-light speeds, predominantly in stasis until arrival and return, meaning a fifty year difference in real time. Carolina's dedication towards exploring those dangerous stars has not diminished whatsoever, though her non-Cosmopolitan family members have all passed on by the third time out in the great unknown (the Cosmopolitan members are nearly equally as hard to contact). Carolina dedicated much of the transit time on expedition two to combat training, to help protect the other members. She also spent a good time learning how to be a mech pilot on the side from a former Lancer, part of the ship's crew. After their return, Carolina put in an application for a grant from her university to get an Everest to protect the Far-Field Team on her third expedition, believing in 'refuge in audacity.' To even her own astonishment, it was granted, and she became the operator of a university donor's ancient Everest. With the mech Ozymandias, King of Kings, Carolina has protected her other team members - even finding some scientific uses for stomping around in a giant mech!

Carolina has spent her twenties and nearly her entire thirties on Far-Field Teams. Though she herself is 37, chronologically, she is 332. Now, she has the experience to be the leader of her own Far-Field Team, and the ambition to want the role. Lyra's university was perfectly willing to back an expedition led by her with its accredited name, proclaiming support for all forms of the humanities and sciences. However, she needs not only backing, but funding, for these expeditions commonly traverse the Periphery, and into The Long Rim. Finding donors - or the cold hard manna herself - is up to Carolina.

The trouble with spending so much time out there, and not much time back in Union, is that Carolina has not learned the vital meet-and-greet brown-nosing required to get powerful donors for an expedition. She has few friends in high places... Not to mention that a mech is kind of expensive to fund.

So, as you do, Carolina's taken her Everest out to make that money herself, for a pilot pays very well indeed. It's all to get the manna for a seventh expedition.

That... Is that really the reason she's a pilot...?

Lyra's ruthless, greedy nature and excited grin when the bullets start flying imply otherwise...

## Appearance
Visibly in her late thirties, with an attractive figure but beginning to show signs of aging. She is 38 years old, but chronologically 332 years old due to nearlight travel.

5'8"/173cm, with long brown hair streaked with the occasional bit of white, and her inner hair coloured blue. Visible body modifications in the form of a short tail and two fully functional fluffy ears atop her head, which augment her normal hearing. While she doesn't show them off much, her canines are sharper as well, and can easily be considered fangs. She insists she got them as natural advantages for exploration. Honest.

## Player Notes
Her long expeditions far from home might have knocked a screw loose. But she is dedicated to exploration, at least!

Lyra's a woman who lives a life full of telling little white lies, the most obvious being her insistence on the reasons for needing her body modifications, and why she needs a heavily armed mech for survey expeditions. The mass majority of the lies Lyra tells are harmless to her life aspirations. When it comes to professional matters, she does truth; her official qualifications are all completely legitimate, her paperwork is totally in order. But Lyra commonly lies in general conversation, telling tall-tales she knows aren't true, or claiming something that she heard on the grapevine happened to her. Years of being eerily aware of those little lies she tells has given her a mortal terror of being revealed as a sham, believing her life could come crashing down if she was exposed. Which leads her to lie even more to cover herself, lies she's again eerily aware of, terrified of them being exposed, leading her to lie and...
