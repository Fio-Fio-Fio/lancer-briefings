## Background
Coralie Richelieu, referred to by friends as Coral or by her call sign Stride Shaker. Is an uppity and happy girl from the fringes of the Union. Born planet side but most often in space, Coral grew up in the nurturing and caring arms of her beloved parents, one a stay-at-home mother, the other a shipping company executive. Coral's father had a controlling stake in 'company name' from its inception in the wider market, and while it cannot compete with many of the major companies, it could handle its own and profit immensely from local trade routes.

Coral fascinated with her father's profession, and with some pleading, slowly started her piloting career at a young age. Having a talent for her she'd be qualified and flying cargo and escorts for her father's company by 20. Young, spoiled, she found a humbled appreciation for all she had working those long flights and dangerous escorts. Even getting her first taste of both in the atmosphere and space combat within the first two years. It was a dream job, she was good at it, and it made her parents ever proud.

Unfortunately, while her Dad's success was enough for them and many at the company, plenty of other players in the galactic industry wanted an inward avenue to a new sector that hadn't be monopolized by the larger players. Her Dad's refusal to sell or even join another larger corporation put him at odds with some of the more nefarious players that he trusted. The result would be an attempted take over one late night of the company, resulting in Coral's father's death.

Unknown to them, excited by his daughter's commitment to the company, and with her mother's permission. His controlling share stood to be inherited by Coral, who at the time had just been deployed on a mission.

Serving as an escort, a sudden call by her panicking Mother would clue Coral in on all the trouble. Having been informed by her father's aide, Coral's mother warned her of actions to be taken against her. A warning that put her on alert and ultimately would save her life as the crew she was with, would attempt to disable her engines and leave her stranded on their way back.

Escaping from near life and death, Coral would find herself on the fringe of space, far from her mother, far from her cozy life. Told by her mother to lay low, to always be with people who she could learn to trust, and to keep fighting until things could be settled. As it stands the company is treating Coral's absence as a girl running from home and has temporarily taken over controlling interests in her father's company. Though she retains the majority of shares and thus prevents the company from being merged or sold, there are people on the lookout for her, to both capture or kill.

Her mother remains at home, guarded closely, though relatively safe. She often funnels funds to Coral to live on so Coral doesn't need to risk pinging herself on any public networks. She only needs to be where her mother says she has to be to get her funds or anything her mother sends her.

In the meantime, keeping with her talented pilot upbringing, and a thrill for some danger seeking. Coral's put her loot in as a lancer, and while her mother is reserved about it. She believes it is for the best, no harm can come to her girl after all if she helps outfit her girl with the best weapon money can buy. A powerful frame.

Now Coral pilots not only to carve her own livelihood, but to keep on surviving till the day comes they can prove who exactly killed her father, and all the actors at play. Till then, it is not safe to come home.

But she's more than happy to send her mom a million pictures of the people she meets and the friends she has along the way!
