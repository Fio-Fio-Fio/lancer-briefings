## Biography
'Alright, so here are the disclosure forms. With these you agree to allow Vixie-chan to stream any combat procedures we engage on, with classified info censored of course! Don’t worry, all my combat software have been SSC approved, though if you want to go hacking through them, go for it!' 

'I did it myself a few times actually. It’s fun!' 

'Ooh, now we probably need streamer identities for you too! This will be fun, we can brainstorm together!' 

Vinessa 'Vixie' 

Known as Vixie-chan, she’s a popular streamer who broadcasts mech combat simulations and the latest lancer video games, though her streaming schedule is varied and irregular unlike many streamers. The truth is much more curious however. She’s an actual mech pilot with licences of her own, and broadcasts her combat experience to the world as a unique streamer experience to her viewers, though few know it as anything more then a simulation. She does actually play lancer simulators, but has a bad habit of calling out their inaccuracies and generally making fun of them. 

Her fox ears and tail are a product of SCC genetic augmentations. In fact, much of her equipment and even licence are SSC branded, which suggests that she either has a multitude of backers, very wealthy connections, or both. She doesn’t talk about where she got much of her equipment, augments, or even where her licence comes from, instead handwaving it with a quaint “A girl has her ways~” and a cute smile, but it would be inconceivable to believe that her popularity as a streamer pays for everything, let alone anything.

## Appearance

'The glasses come off when I'm serious' - Vixie' 
Due to SSC genome therapy from even before she was born, it's a difficult to tell what hasn't been augmented and what hasn't. The two most obvious is her black and silver fox ears and tail, and her cat-like eyes. Otherwise she appears to be a normal human girl, even short by the standards of most people. She prefers to wear black and loose clothing when she's not streaming, and generally prefers causal and comfy clothing options when combat and hardsuits aren't involved (and sometimes when they are). Like most SSC augmented individuals, she does have mechanical augments and neurolinks, but they're tastefully hidden underneath the skin and as unobtrusive as possible. To the average passer-by they might think she was completely unaugmented, minus the ear, tail and eyes. 

She enjoys wearing glasses even if they don't do anything. It's good aesthetic
