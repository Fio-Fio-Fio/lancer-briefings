## PILOT BIOGRAPHY
Jóhanna "Chariot" Landon is a Harrison Armory Legionnaire formerly affiliated with the now-defunct "Chimera's Fangs" subdivision of Armory Legion Ivis. 

Her service record boasts an impressive history both within the Armory, and before her enlistment. Born to a wartorn planet ruled by a Tyrant, Chariot joined the ranks of Legion Ivis after the successful liberation of her homeworld and it's integration into the Armory's Purview. Despite being rejected multiple times by the legion, her perseverance eventually won through after convincing Legion Commander James "Chimera" Landon to take her onboard as both a Legionnaire, and a protégé. Earning her place as second-in-command of the "Chimera's Fangs" Elite Strike Force after serving years within the group.

 Chariot rarely ever touches upon the subject of her life before the Legion, merely stating that she was "Just another victim of a ruthless oppression." and that she enlisted with "the hope that no one would ever suffer as my world had suffered.". Post-battle reports from the local rebel forces on her homeland mention her name several times in crucial battles between mechanized cavalry. Which begs the question, why was a gifted young pilot initially rejected? 

Such a question will likely never have an answer, as "Chimera", shortly after legally adopting Jóhanna as his daughter, passed away under mysterious circumstances. 

Following her adoptive father's death, Jóhanna has chosen not to return to Legion Ivis, and instead has opted to volunteer for several Armory-Union joint projects, citing "Needing a change of pace" as her reason for doing so. Due to her rank and status, this often has her acting as the liaison between the two parties. Diligent, earnest, and a times a bit naïve, her work has been praised by the Union personnel that have worked with her, stating that she behaves in some ways that are entirely expected of a Legionnaire, yet completely unexpected in other ways.

These joint operations offer Chariot the chance to broaden her horizons while remaining loyal and in-service to the Armory. Needless to say, she's enthusiastic and prepared to tackle whatever this strange galaxy might throw her way. 

... At least. She hopes she's prepared ...
