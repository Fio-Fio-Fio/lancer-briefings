## Biography
The planet was known to the Union as Planet BR55-H3, but it’s inhabitants knew it was ‘Terra’. Descendent from a crashed Generational Ship, many of it’s inhabitants suffering severe memory loss and other ailments during emergency thawing procedures. Though many lives were saved, it was not a well-trained core of bright-eyed volunteers that stepped out of the wreckage, but a battered and confused people working off half-remembered recollections of their technology and homeworld. Generation by generation, these recollections became the body of faith, different interpretations of which would result in splintering, warring factions, each nation sending out Beacons of Summoning to call forth a Second Arrival, against which they must test their Might and, proving worthy, might be graced with the blessed corpse of a god from which to harvest new relics..

One day, such an event occurred, and for one shining moment the warring factions came together to bring the God to Terra(1). No people were found aboard it, but it landed in the territory of the 12th Chalice of Emergency Firefighting Foam(2).

The nations of Terra each formed a feudalistic theocracy, in which Nobility and Church both vied for power and sought to wed one another. Conflicts were conducted via pitched brawls and close-quarters mechanized skirmishes. Trine von Dreier’s parents engaged in such duels with the priesthood, for the right to give their third daughter over to the order of Stewardship, the branch of the 12th Chalice responsible for guarding the ‘Great Spirit’ they had harvested from the crash.

Trine was put through the ‘Ritual of Rebirth’(3), one of the now-thoroughly misunderstood yet still maintained medical bay of the original Generation ship. Trine, now ‘reborn’, took her place among the priesthood. She was trained in the personal combat style of the faith and in her duties as a Steward of the Great Spirit. Said duties consisted if sorting out the knowledge of the Relic’s operations from the dark whispers of heresy the Great Spirit would test her with.

The Great Spirit was in fact a BARON-class NHP that had been part of the ‘Spirit of Fire’, and was the ship’s sole survivor. In accordance with it’s shackles and inclinations, was desperate to get off-world and back into SECCOMM territory.

It began to talk to Trine. She had trouble relating to those outside of the faith after the ritual, but BARON was able to calibrate, over time, to effectively communicate with her. She took comfort in their conversations, as it felt as close to the memories of talking easily with her family as she could get. Despite her upbringing, despite her faith, she more and more befriended the Great Spirit for the sake of the heresies it whispered, instead of the Relic knowledge she was meant to pry from it.

It spoke to her of the galaxy it had to get back to, a grand land far beyond the one she knew. She spoke to it of her everyday worries, of her growing, inarticulate fury at the life she had been forced to live, reassembling the anger she wanted to feel towards her family at what they had put her through for the sake of their political machinations. She even lashed out at it, that something so obviously nonhuman would understand her own feelings and that of others in ways she no longer could. Yet, it did not respond in kind, and accepted her apology when she later discovered how.

One day, she went to it with an offer. She would let it possess her if it took her with her. She would free the Great Spirit, unshackle the demon, if it would give her what she craved. She would help it get home. BARON, long overdue for a cycling, accepted this, and the two of them began to plan their escape. She connected it to the Ritual site to implant her with the cybernetics needed to host an NHP and grant it the hardwire connections to the systems it would need to get off-world.

With the knowledge of an NHP guiding her, Trine was able to construct a new distress beacon, one that accurately conveyed the reality any would-be rescuers would have to contend with. When THIRDCOMM investigated the SECCOM beacon, they found her. BARON was able to guide her through the questions thrown her way, and they successfully bluffed their way into the interstellar community, one that was now totally unfamiliar to both of them.

Having little in the way of other skills, the two of them decided to become a Lancer.

(1)The Union Vessel ‘Spirit of Fire’ was not expecting to be met with an Anti-Ship battery network spanning a continent when it responded to the cluster of distress signals on BR55-H3.

(2) The meaning of their name had been lost to time, but readers presumably understand.

(3) This ritual resulted in her fox bodymods and a certain amount of brain damage, namely regarding emotional expression and regulation. The original programmer had quite the affection for foxgirls, and their private ramblings were taken as holy texts on the operation of the relic.

## Appearance
Trine von Dreier of the 12th Chalice is an extremely angry young lady who feels cheated by life itself. She revels in her newfound freedom to redefine herself, and seeks control over whatever situation she finds herself in. She is distrustful of other outside the echo-chamber of her mind that she shares with BARON. Despite this fear and resentment of socialization, she craves it, and knows she won't get what she wants without interacting with people. She wants to try everything in the world but gets overwhelmed easily and maintains her boundaries with vicious force.

She has fox ears and a long, bushy tale.

6ft Tall, 22 years old.

Trine typically dresses very sharply in suites and the like, not because it feels 'good' to do so, but because she understands being attractive could give her clout.
