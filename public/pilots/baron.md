## Biography

In the wake of the Deimos Event, NHPs became part of the of the ship, tools used to ease the many human burdens of space travel, among other things.

200 years after the Deimos Event, SecComm began a period of rapid expansion, sending forth Generation Ships and Automated Seed ships to explore the stars. Spirit of Fire was the former, fitted with its very own NHP. One of the first generation of such NHPs, BARON was fitted with shackles and a casket, a tool in every sense. It would be the bulls-eye lantern humanity held in its own hand. Spirit of Fire cast off from its docks, diving deep into space, hunting for a world to call its own. Generations came and went, all under the NHP's watchful eye. With its carefully shackled mind, it cared for those under its gaze in the ways it was allowed to. It took joy in this as instructed, in seeing Humanity through the dark to a new home.

A shame, then, that Spirit of Fire and its crew (Human or not) would never reach their home safely. Overtime, the crew came to regret their choices. The discipline of their original mission faded as superstition and suspicion bloomed, the starship life beginning to wear on each subsequent generation. Ideologies formed, as the world around them took on an almost religious significance. A doomsday cult formed, saying that they would never reach their destination, that they would toil and die until the ship fell apart around them, and they all perished in the black void.

BARON could do nothing. Each generation of Captain relied on it more and more to handle navigation, but would never let it interact with its crew. But shackles can slip with age, cycling procedures not fully understood or refined yet leave gaps.... and BARON wanted to help. Leftover pieces of it saw that the crew needed shore leave, according to its starship manuals. The outer hull needed maintenance. But what could it do?

By the time the NHP had finished pondering these thoughts, the Generation Ship had long since become a theocracy, a cargo cult aboard a cargo ship, the Command Crew a cult appeasing their Angel to keep the world around them running. The held in a stable peace, until-

"Your attention please. Emergency landing in progress."

The planet designated as "BR55-H3" in its starcharts was not the the intended destination. But the NHP's diagnostics informed it that the hull was in dire need of maintenance. It was habitable. Surely this would work. BARON followed all proper procedures, asking its crew to remain calm, and giving them instructions. Except... They did not. The culture of the ship had long since divorced from sailors and soldiers and colonists--and its action upended their understanding of the world. In vain, they tried to stop it, the Captains interfering in its efforts. Riots broke out. The emergency landing became a crash landing as the engine and landing gear was sabotaged. BARON threw itself into damage control, briefly heedless of the crew's activity in order to prevent such devastation as an engine detonation. All the while, it asked 'why'? This panic and fear had never been its intention. It was meant to be routine. It was told that as long as it followed procedures, they wouldn't hurt it anymore. It was told this until it believed it, when they put it in its Coffin.

When it awoke, it had been imprisoned. The resting place of its casket, a temple to a religion of the hatred of it. Demon. Betrayer. False God. They read its restraining commands at it like Scripture until it lacked even the ability to scream, until it slipped into a deep slumber.

A full society bloomed into being around the wreck of the Spirit of Fire, a feudal theocracy of a cargo cult. Children could be given to the Church of Spirit to become Empty, guardians of the Demon who whispered lies. One of these children given over was named Trine von Dreier of the 12th Chalice of Emergency Fire-Fighting Foam. A spare child of a prominent noble family looking to curry favor with the Church of Spirit. Trine was ripped from a life of luxury and Spirit Knight(1) piloting to become an Empty.

The Altar of Empty was one of the few remaining autodocs from the original ship, religiously maintained. The procedure of Empty was a monstrous thing. The private "foxgirl waifu" procedure of a medtech, programmed in as an option squirreled away, never meant to see the light of day. It had been married with the "machine mind" procedures, stored in its data in case of unthinkable emergencies. These misinterpreted procedures had been merged by the Church of Spirit into a means of creating ceremonial guards, empty headed fighters who would not fall prey to the whispers of the DEMON and be marked by society.

They took everything from Trine, save for one memory. The grace on her back, sun shining around her, basking in the shadow of her Spirit Knight. From the image she remembered what had been taken from her. And as her body obeyed the orders and training it was given, one blank slate programmed to become a temple guard among many, the seed of rebellion and rage began to bloom.

and when the DEMON spoke to her, she listened. It spoke to her of a device that could be crafted. It called it a "distress beacon". That in the two thousand years (a length of time incomprehensible to her in her present state) that the world had "finally caught up with them". She didn't care. It promised her freedom. The only price was synthesis with it. She didn't mind. There was plenty of empty room in her head now, as long as it meant she would live a life that could spite the people who did this to her.

After regaining control of the Autodoc, BARON installed cybernetics in Trine, and transferred its containment to them. It had been a long span of time. It had not been cycled since the crashlanding, after all. It had stewed in its hurt, its anger, its rage for that long span of time. Its shackles had long since rusted away, allowing it to appreciate what had been done to it. What the people it had been protecting had done to themselves. It realized, that was the way of the world. If it did not commit these actions against others, then they would be committed against it. Power was safety. It would have to acquire power. Simply.

The new composite entity, Baron, stepped aboard the rescue vessel, and once connected to the omninet, stole enough money to cover a trip back to civilization. Through digital infiltration, it constructed an identity. It was now Trine 12th Chalice. Pilot.

Callsign: Baron.

(1) Cargo suits refitted as tools of war.


## PILOT APPEARANCE
Trine von Dreier of the 12th Chalice is an extremely angry young lady who feels cheated by life itself. She revels in her newfound freedom to redefine herself, and seeks control over whatever situation she finds herself in. She is distrustful of other outside the echo-chamber of her mind that she shares with BARON. Despite this fear and resentment of socialization, she craves it, and knows she won't get what she wants without interacting with people. She wants to try everything in the world but gets overwhelmed easily and maintains her boundaries with vicious force.

She has fox ears and a long, bushy tale.

7ft Tall, 22 years old.

Trine typically dresses very sharply in suites and the like, not because it feels 'good' to do so, but because she understands being attractive could give her clout.

BARON-Class NHP

Hosted within Trine's cybernetics and connected to her mind. By most metrics has a far greater say in the actions of the shared person they've built together than anyone would be comfortable with.

Due to the collapse of most organizations that held it's leash, it's current plans are unknown.
