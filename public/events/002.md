# EVENT LOG // ENTRY #002-1, EVERGREEN 

On 4/xx/5014u at approximately 02:00, the enemy force known only as the "Rangers" launched the first attack of a multi-layered offensive against the settlement of **Evergreen**, beginning with a small skirmish at the city's main gate that was eventually revealed to be a distraction for their forces to assault critical power infrastructure.

Coordinating with **Evergreen**’s Militia, **Unit A42** was able to completely deter the attackers from damaging the city’s external reactor. This second attack was believed to be the end of the assault until a seemingly last-ditch effort was launched at the city itself. 

The ensuing battle saw the loss of one Chassis on the side of Unit A42, and multiple enemy cavalry being destroyed in the streets of evergreen. The civilian casualties are still being being counted but Unit A42 was able to draw fire away from the buildings to the best of our ability.

Among the Ranger's usual SecComm-era salvaged mechanized chassis, a chassis that appears to be a prototype of the Harrison Armory Tokugawa was recovered by **Unit A42**

**"Chariot"** has reached out to Purview Oversight for any information they can provide on this prototype model, there has been no response so far.

P.S. Apologies for this report failing to meet the standards of the DoJ/HR, a more detailed report will be filed when I don’t have a squadmate glaring at me for working with a broken arm.		***- J.L.***
