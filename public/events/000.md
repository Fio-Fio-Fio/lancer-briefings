At 03:30, January 18th, 499ay / 5014u, all five members of DoJ/HR Union Auxillary Unit A42 rendezvoused at the Atlas Line, Ouanoukrim Blink Station. Despite the late arrivals of “Carolina” and “Strideshaker”, along with “Vixie” and “Baron” causing issues for the unit with their belongings. Unit-A42 successfully made the transfer from Atlas-Ouanoukrim to local station Oriel-2 within an acceptable timeframe.

Aboard Oriel-2, Unit A42 made contact with DoJ/HR Liaison, Pilot, and acting commanding officer of Unit A42 “Yano”.

“Yano” was moderately hungover and unprofessional at time of contact.

After ensuring “Yano”’s ship was up to Union standards (Albeit, by a narrow margin.), Unit A42 has boarded and began the voyage to their destination. ETA is Mid-Late March, with subjective travel time being close to one week.
