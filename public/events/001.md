# EVENT LOG // ENTRY #001-1, GOVERNER'S FARM 

**Unit A42** made contact with **Landmark Colonial** Administrator NHP **PATIENCE**, along with **Edena Ji** their handler, at the heart of **Evergreen**, a wall administrative complex known as the **Governor's Farm.**

**PATIENCE** reported to Unit A42 the situation at hand: **Evergreen** is under assault and harassment by unknown forces from outside the colony for roughly a month. The Militiamen believe it could be the remnants of a long-dead indigenous species of Instinct known as the **"Egregorians"**. A Claim which **PATIENCE** shuns but does not completely deny, insisting it is the work of much more likely individuals, offworld pirates and raiders.. The fact of the matter is that **Evergreen** needs help. 

# EVENT LOG // ENTRY #001-2, GOVERNER'S FARM 

**Unit A42** was given two options to provide immediate assistance to the colony. There's only time for one.

The first , track down and neutralize the enemy sniper attacks that were harassing **Evergreen**. These attacks both terrified the citizenry and halted almost all progress from being made on projects outside of the city walls. This would greatly reduce the pressure on the colony.

The second, assist Chief Engineer **Castor Fielding** in a project. The settlement's landing bowl is currently flooded and in desperate need of critical repairs, but the mission is risky with raiders almost guaranteed to attack and disrupt the repair attempts. Repairing the bowl means offworld landings would be much easier and far less risky.

Presented with these options, by vote of 4 to 1, **Unit A42** selected to launch a counter offensive against the enemy sniper.

# DR. LYRA VICKER'S NOTES, ENTRY #001-3-A

*All of this is conjecture, of course, But there's plenty of cultures ThirdComm had to reconnect with who gained independence in the chaos of the Revolution, and were extremely hostile to anyone claiming to be 'Union' when their ancestral memory of 'Union' is a horrifically chauvinist society.*

*It does, however, mean we are dealing with something on a higher scale than our previous perception of it possibly being just some sort of pirates.*

*I'm betting the chitin on the 'mechs are just what they look like to me: decorative. Oh, I wish I knew more about their society, I'm sure the reason for it all is fascinating...*
